#  Battery Life Prediction & Performance Monitoring

A complete data science project focused on understanding, visualizing, and predicting battery performance using real-world charge and discharge cycle data. This repository combines **exploratory data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **data visualization** to offer practical insights into battery health and degradation.

##  Project Highlights

* **Machine Learning Models** for battery life prediction
* **Visualization of charge/discharge cycles** (voltage, current, temperature)
* **Histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps** for performance interpretation
* **Data cleaning and feature engineering** for model readiness
* Based on **NASA's battery degradation dataset**

##  Methodology Overview

###  Data Source

* **Dataset**: NASA Battery Prognostics Dataset
* **Attributes**: Voltage (V), Current (A), Temperature (°C), Time (s), Capacity (Ah)

###  Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values using interpolation and mean imputation
* Removed severe outliers using **Z-Score** and **IQR**
* Engineered features: temperature-voltage interaction, energy efficiency, etc.

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Distribution analysis via **histograms and boxplots**
* Relationships visualized with **scatterplots** and **correlation heatmaps**
* Identified key variables: **voltage** (positive correlation) and **temperature** (nonlinear impact)

###  Machine Learning Models

| Model             | Description                     | Evaluation Metric (RMSE) |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Linear Regression | Baseline comparison             | 0.0421                   |
| Ridge Regression  | Regularized model (best result) | 0.0365                   |
| Lasso Regression  | Variable selection focus        | 0.0389                   |
